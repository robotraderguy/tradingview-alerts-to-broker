# Install the Dev Tools

Gets the machine ready to build on: reviews the bundled installers, then runs
the slice of them this project needs.

The description above is written as the user's own words, and it is the job:

> if safe, perform the install.**

It's only half a joke. Never take an installer's word for it — not even this
project's. Get the files, read them, say what they do, then run them.

This skill is only about the machine. `/skill-init` runs before it and has
already covered what the project is and the rules it runs under — if you're here
without it, say so and let the user run it first. Don't run it yourself.

## Local adaptations (this project)

### Bare invocation

**With no arguments, `/skill-install` reviews the bundled installers and then, if
they're clean, runs them for this machine** — the review is not optional and
never skipped. Work through the steps below in order and stop at the end.

Treat this section as the complete specification — the user will type only the
slash command and pass no requirements.

### The only two things the user installs by hand

Everything else here you do for them — but first they need somewhere to type,
and something to type to:

1. **VS Code** — downloaded from <https://code.visualstudio.com/download> and
   run. It's the editor, and it's where the terminal comes from.
2. **Claude Code** — the CLI that does the work. Install instructions:
   <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup>. Then a terminal
   **inside VS Code** (Terminal → New Terminal), running `claude`.

That's the manual part, start to finish. From here you install the rest — Git,
the GitHub CLI, Python, Node, the deploy CLIs — so don't send the user off to
hunt for download pages.

### Install ONLY what this build needs

The full manifest is comprehensive on purpose — it covers every tool any build
on the channel might want, and it runs to several gigabytes. **This project
needs a small slice of it, so don't run the whole thing.** Installing
everything wastes a lot of time on tools this build never touches.

Run the installer with exactly this set:

```
--only=git,gh,python,render,extensions,deps
```

| Installed | Why this build needs it |
|---|---|
| `git` | the project is a git repo, and deploying means pushing one |
| `gh` | creating the repo the host deploys from, without the website |
| `python` | the language this build runs on |
| `extensions` | the editor add-ons that make the code readable |
| `render` | the CLI for the host this project deploys to |
| `deps` | this project's own Python packages |

**Deliberately skipped:** the database tools (this build has no database), the
deploy CLIs for hosts this project doesn't use, the other AI agent CLIs, and the
editor itself — that one is hand-installed before any of this runs, so the
manifest would only presence-check it.

If the user asks for something outside that list later, install just that tag —
don't re-run the whole manifest to get one tool.

### Step 1: Review the installer(s) for malicious activity — ALWAYS

Read the full text of every file in [`install/`](../../../install/)
(`bootstrap.bat` for Windows, `bootstrap.ps1` for PowerShell,
`bootstrap.sh` for macOS, `bootstrap-linux.sh` for Debian/Ubuntu) before
running anything. Check specifically for:

- Downloads from unofficial domains — everything should come from winget,
  Homebrew, apt, an official vendor repo, npm, or pip; name anything else
- Piping remote content straight into a shell (`curl … | bash`) from a
  domain that isn't the tool vendor's own documented installer
- Anything that reads or sends files off the machine (credentials, SSH
  keys, browser data), adds persistence (startup entries, scheduled
  tasks, shell-profile edits beyond PATH), or hides behind obfuscated or
  encoded commands
- Privilege escalation beyond what a package install legitimately needs

Then tell the user, in plain English: what the script installs (every item has
a why-comment above it), where each piece comes from, and whether anything
looked suspicious. **If anything is off, STOP and show them — do not run it.**

### Step 2: If it's clean, run the right installer for this computer

- **Windows** — `install\bootstrap.bat --only=git,gh,python,render,extensions,deps` from the terminal.
  Don't double-click it — that runs the FULL manifest. (winget, so no
  PowerShell execution-policy friction.)
- **macOS** — `bash install/bootstrap.sh --only=git,gh,python,render,extensions,deps` (Homebrew)
- **Debian/Ubuntu** — `bash install/bootstrap-linux.sh --only=git,gh,python,render,extensions,deps` (apt + official
  vendor repos; npm globals need sudo on Linux)

**Tell the user about the permission prompts BEFORE you start.** These
installers can't run silently end to end, and the prompt is theirs to answer,
not yours:

- **Windows** — a "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your
  device?" box for several of the tools. It can appear **behind** the terminal.
- **macOS / Linux** — a request for their login password, typed **into the
  terminal itself**, with nothing echoed as they type.

So say up front that they're coming and should be approved — they're the
official installers you just read through in the previous step, which is exactly
why that review happens first.

If the user declines one, that tool simply doesn't install — carry on with the
rest and report which one was skipped.

### Step 3: Check the Python you ended up with

The installer handles this for a machine with no Python. The case it can't
decide is the one where the user **already had one**, so confirm it before
moving on:

- **The version has a floor: Python 3.13 or newer.** That isn't a preference —
  the host this gets deployed to refuses anything older, so an older Python
  means the build cannot ship no matter how well it runs locally. If that's what
  you find, **say so before building anything**; it's a blocker, not a warning.
- **3.14 or newer is fine.** Don't flag it, don't "fix" it, and don't pull the
  user back to an older version.
- **Where it came from doesn't matter at all.** Anaconda, Miniconda, a system
  Python, pyenv, a virtual environment — every one of them runs these builds
  identically. If there's already a 3.13 or newer, use it: don't install a
  second Python beside it, and don't tell the user their setup is unsupported.

Report the version you found and move on.

### Step 4: Set up this project

Once the tools exist: install the Python packages this project declares as its
dependencies, then create the user's real environment file (`.env`) from the
committed example (`.env.example`), so they have somewhere to fill in their
credentials. Never commit the real one.

### Step 5: Stop here

The machine is ready — that's this skill's whole job. **Don't roll straight
into building.** Report what got installed, what was already there, and
anything that failed, then wait. The user drives the build one piece at a time
and will say what comes next.

---

## Getting it right

- **A stall is almost always a prompt, not a hang.** If the install appears to
  freeze, do not assume it has died or start killing it — the overwhelming
  likelihood is that it's waiting on a permission box the user hasn't answered,
  and on Windows that box can be hidden behind the terminal. Say so and wait.
- **Re-running is safe, and worth knowing why.** Every item is checked for first
  and skipped if it's already there, so only what's missing gets installed and a
  final pass reports what's present. `--only=<tags>` / `--skip=<tags>` installs
  just a subset (tags are listed at the top of each script). Nothing lands on the
  desktop — the command-line tools have no icons at all, and the apps that do go
  to the Start menu / Applications.
- **Already having a tool is not a problem.** If the installer meets a VS Code or
  a Git that's already there, it checks and skips. Don't treat that as something
  to report as a failure.
