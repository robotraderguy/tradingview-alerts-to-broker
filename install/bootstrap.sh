# WHAT THIS DOES: installs the tools used in the build videos
# (Git, GitHub CLI, VS Code, Python (Miniconda), Node.js, the
# deploy CLIs - Heroku, Fly.io, Google Cloud SDK, Railway, Render
# - MongoDB Community + mongosh + Compass, three AI agent CLIs,
# and the clasp/Firebase/Linode platform CLIs) via Homebrew
# (installed first if missing) + npm + pip, from official
# taps/casks. Nothing else. Start the local DB with:
# brew services start mongodb-community
# Each item below has a one-line note on WHY it's installed.
#
# LINUX USERS: use bootstrap-linux.sh instead. (Verified on a
# blank Linux box: Homebrew's installer needs Git preinstalled
# and casks are mac-only - the two worlds don't merge cleanly.)
#
# DISCLAIMER: provided as-is, no warranty. Review before running
# (it's short and readable on purpose). Installs may prompt for
# your password. Educational use; you are responsible for
# software installed on your machine.
#
# Run this file directly, OR install an AI coding agent first
# (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini) and let IT run the file - the
# installer sets up all three, so you're covered whichever agent you
# use. The videos are built with Claude Code.
#
# Lean install (only some tools, or all-but-some):
#   ./bootstrap.sh --only=git,gh,python      # ONLY these tags
#   ./bootstrap.sh --skip=mongo,compass      # everything EXCEPT these
# Tags: git gh vscode python node heroku fly gcloud railway render
#   mongo compass aws az doctl claude codex gemini clasp firebase
#   linode extensions deps  (see the manifest below).
