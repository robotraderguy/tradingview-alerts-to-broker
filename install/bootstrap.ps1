# WHAT THIS DOES: installs the tools used in the build videos
# (Git, GitHub CLI, VS Code, Python, Node.js, the deploy CLIs -
# Heroku, Fly.io, Google Cloud SDK, Railway - MongoDB Community
# Server + mongosh + Compass, three AI agent CLIs, and the
# clasp/Firebase/Linode platform CLIs) from OFFICIAL sources via
# winget/npm/pip. Nothing else. Each item below has a one-line
# note on WHY it's installed. (Local MongoDB = fast offline dev
# loop; Atlas stays the cloud database the deployed bot uses.)
#
# DISCLAIMER: provided as-is, no warranty. Review before running
# (it's short and readable on purpose). Some installs may prompt
# for admin approval. Educational use; you are responsible for
# software installed on your machine.
#
# Run:  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass; .\bootstrap.ps1
# (or just double-click bootstrap.bat - same manifest, no policy step)
#
# Lean install (only some tools, or all-but-some):
#   .\bootstrap.ps1 -Only git,gh,python      # ONLY these tags
#   .\bootstrap.ps1 -Skip mongo,compass      # everything EXCEPT these
# Tags: git gh vscode python node heroku fly gcloud mongo mongosh
#   compass railway render aws az doctl claude codex gemini clasp firebase
#   linode extensions deps  (see the manifest below).
