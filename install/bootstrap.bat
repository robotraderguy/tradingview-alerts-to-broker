REM  WHAT THIS DOES: installs the tools used in the build videos
REM  (Git, GitHub CLI, VS Code, Python, Node.js, the deploy CLIs
REM  - Heroku, Fly.io, Google Cloud SDK, Railway - MongoDB
REM  Community Server + mongosh + Compass, three AI agent CLIs,
REM  and the clasp/Firebase/Linode platform CLIs) from their
REM  OFFICIAL sources via winget, Microsoft's built-in package
REM  manager, plus npm and pip. Nothing else is downloaded.
REM  (Local MongoDB = fast offline dev loop; Atlas stays the
REM  deployed bot's database.) Each item has a one-line WHY.
REM
REM  DISCLAIMER: provided as-is, no warranty. Review this file
REM  before running (it is short and readable on purpose). Some
REM  installs may prompt for admin approval. Educational use;
REM  you are responsible for software installed on your machine.
REM
REM  Run this file directly (double-click), OR install an AI coding
REM  agent first (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini) and let IT run the
REM  file - the installer sets up all three, so you're covered
REM  whichever agent you use. The videos are built with Claude Code.
REM
REM  Lean install (only some tools, or all-but-some):
REM    bootstrap.bat --only=git,gh,python      (ONLY these tags)
REM    bootstrap.bat --skip=mongo,compass      (everything EXCEPT these)
REM  Tags: git gh vscode python node heroku fly gcloud mongo mongosh
REM    compass railway render aws az doctl claude codex gemini clasp firebase
REM    linode extensions deps  (see the manifest below).
REM ============================================================

REM --- Script directory, captured BEFORE the arg parser runs. `shift` below
REM     moves %0 as well as %1, so after parsing any argument %~dp0 no longer
REM     points at this script - it resolves against the current directory
REM     instead. Anything that needs a file next to this script must use
REM     %HERE%, never %~dp0. (This bit once sent the Render helper lookup to
REM     the repo root, and only when arguments were passed.) ---

echo  Heads up: the FULL manifest is roughly 5 GB of disk ^(the Google Cloud SDK,
echo  Azure CLI, MongoDB and VS Code are the biggest^). You almost certainly do NOT
echo  want all of it - a project only needs a few of these, so pass --only=... with
echo  the tags for the build you're doing.
echo.
echo  Rough timings on a normal broadband connection:
echo    - everything, from nothing installed .... 25-45 min
echo    - everything, already installed ......... 2-5 min ^(just version checks^)
echo    - a typical --only set for one project .. 3-8 min
echo.
echo  Safe to re-run: anything already present is detected, and upgraded if it's
echo  an old version rather than skipped.
echo.
echo  [!] EXPECT PERMISSION POPUPS. Windows will ask "Do you want to allow this
echo      app to make changes to your device?" for several of these installers
echo      ^(Git, Node, VS Code, MongoDB and others^). That is normal - they are the
echo      official installers you just reviewed. Click YES each time, or the tool
echo      it is asking about will not install.
echo.
echo      The window can open BEHIND this one, and installing pauses until you
echo      answer. If this looks frozen, check your taskbar for a prompt waiting.
